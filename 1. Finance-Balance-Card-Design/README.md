# Design Recreation: Crypto Finance Application (Home Screen)

## ‚ú® Overview
This project is a recreation of an eye-catching design by [@Boardmaths(twitter-x)](https://x.com/Boardmaths) that I discovered on Twitter. I took on the challenge of turning this design into code, utilizing `Vite`, `TailwindCSS`, `SwiperJS`, and `SCSS`.
